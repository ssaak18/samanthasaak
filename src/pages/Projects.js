          description="I developed a novel Amazon Alexa interface with a mobile-manipulator robot for 
          increased accessibility in human-robot interactions. My project presents a case study for
           using Virtual Assistants as accessible user interfaces for home assistance robots. 
           It successfully demonstrates how Amazon's Alexa can be used as a voice interface 
           for a robot to perform command grouping tasks based on user input. 
           The project utilizes the Alexa Skills Kit to process Alexa interactions, 
           ROS to communicate with the robot, and Flask to develop the web interface. 
           My work was accepted for presentation at the New England Robotics Colloquium 
           (NERC) for Fall 2024. "

          description="I worked in a group of four to develop a simulator for evolving artificial life. 
          I developed a backend parser to handle custom language programs and a graphical user 
          interface that enables users to take control of individual specimens as they move, eat, 
          reproduce, and evolve. I worked mainly on the backend data structures for parsing and 
          interpreting the custom language program, the efficiency of the GUI and user interactions,
           and the overall organization of my team. "

          description="As the lead engineer for my FIRST Robotics Competition team, I coordinated efforts across the mechanical, 
          electrical, and software subteams, contributing to the full robot development. Hardware wise, I designed a shooting 
          mechanism and oversaw electrical wiring of the robot. In my software work, I utilized an existing program to calculate 
          time-optimal trajectories, considering robot movement and pose constraints, and developed a robust autonomous scheduler. 
          The scheduler coordinated the robotâ€™s arm movements, intake system, and shooting mechanism, automatically generating the 
          necessary movements for any path with the ability to adjust to dynamic conditions. This enabled our robot to efficiently 
          move and pick up multiple foam rings and shoot them at a target with precision."
